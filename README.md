# Bouldering Coloring Book Plus - Web
## BCB+W or BCBPW

This is a project by log<sub>a</sub>n as a part of the SD Mines Hardrocker Climbing Club. 

The goal of this project is to enable climbers at SD Mines to create and share their own routes for the SD Mines Bouldering Wall.

The goal for me working on this project is to learn some HTML5, JavaScript, WebGL, and other various techniques to improve myself as a software engineer.

If you have any suggestions for this project, please put them in the issues tab. Type: `g` `i`.

If you wish to help out on this project, you can find me at the bouldering wall *very* often, or you comment on something to get my attention.
